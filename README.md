## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a committed learner currently pursuing the **Backend specialization** at **ALX PRODEV Software Engineering Program**. I made the leap into software engineering because I believe in the power of technology to **transform communities** and **drive meaningful change** — especially in the education sector.

🎯 **My Vision**:  
To **build solutions that improve the quality of basic education**, particularly in underserved and ASAL (Arid and Semi-Arid Lands) regions of Kenya and beyond.

💡 **What Inspires Me**:  
The impact that well-designed digital tools can have on students, teachers, and administrators alike — streamlining workflows, improving outcomes, and scaling access to learning opportunities.

📌 **I’m Interested In Working On**:
- Education systems & school management platforms  
- Digital workflows for teaching and learning  
- Community-focused open source software  
- Backend systems that drive scalable, impactful apps
